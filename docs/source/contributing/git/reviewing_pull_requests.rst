Reviewing pull requests
=======================

Quickstart
----------

..  note::
    Before doing anything else, if you are reviewing a bugfix pull
    request, you must first reproduce the issue on the main development
    branch as mentioned in the :ref:`reviewing-a-bugfix-pr`.

Add the following git alias to your ``.gitconfig`` file (e.g. the one
located in your home directory):

.. code-block:: ini

    [alias]
        pr = "!f() { \
            git fetch -fu ${2:-<remote_main>} refs/pull/$1/head:pr/$1 && \
            git checkout pr/$1; \
        }; f"

In the alias ``<remote_main>`` stands for the name of the remote
representing the main development repository, i.e. the one the pull
requests are sent to. Such a remote is commonly named ``upstream``. You
need to make sure to insert the correct name in the above alias
definition.

With the alias defined, go to the project root directory and type the
following in the console:

.. code-block:: bash

    git pr <pr_number>

This command will automatically fetch and checkout the branch containing
the changes in the pull request ``<pr_number>``, e.g. 1234.

*NOTE: The command must be run on a clean repository. If you have any
pending local changes, you first need to put them aside by running
``git stash``, or discarding them altogether.*

If the pull request contains database changes (marked with the
``migration`` label), you need to update the database as well before you
start reviewing the changes.

With the PR branch fetched, you need to merge it with the branch the PR
was made against, usually - but not always - ``develop``, and test how
the *merged* code performs.

When you have everything set up, start the application and verify that
everything works as intended (see the :ref:`reviewing-and-merging-pull-requests`
for details). If the pull request turns out to be good, you can merge it,
provided that all the :ref:`merging-pull-requests` are met.

On the other hand, if there are :ref:`reasons to reject <acceptance-criteria>`
a pull request, leave the feedback in the comment(s), so that the author
can make the necessary changes.


Using GitHub labels
-------------------

There are several labels defined on the GitHub project repository page
that can (and should!) be used for tagging pull requests. Labeling
enables easier PR categorization and searching, thus make sure to use
them.

The meaning of the labels and their intended usage is as follows (sorted
alphabetically):

- ``kokoro:run`` - mark the PR to run kokoro automated tests, Should be added
  after any new code push to a PR.
- ``kokoro:force-run`` - mark the PR to run the kokoro tests again even without
  any new code changes
- ``code freeze`` - the PR should not be merged due to the ongoing QA testing.
  Used at the end of the sprint, when extensive QA testing is started,
- ``critical`` - the PR has the highest possible priority and should thus be
  reviewed *immediately*. Cases when applying this label is justifiable are,
  among others, when a PR fixes a blocking issue or a severe issue that needs
  to be shipped to production in the shortest time possible. Should be used
  sparsely,
- ``documentation`` - the PR contains updates to project documentation,
- ``migration`` - the PR contains a migration script that changes the
  database schema. Such pull requests require additional setup and
  verification steps,
- ``check migration chain`` - the revision numbers in the migration must be
  verified, because another PR with a migration has been merged. This label
  must always be used together with `kokoro:force-run` on all open PRs with
  migration after any migration is merged.
- ``mising tests`` - the changes submitted are not sufficiently covered with
  automated tests, and the latter need to be added,
- ``needs work`` - a reviewer or the PR author has concluded that the PR
  requires additional work before it can be accepted and merged,
- ``new contribution`` - the PR author is a new contributor that might not yet
  be familiar with the project workflow, conventions, and other nuances. Please
  take extra care and effort to answer all the questions, and to explain things
  as necessary in a welcoming manner, even if they might seem trivial to
  a seasoned contributor,
- ``next release`` - the PR will be merged after the current release
  has branched off of the main development branch, and should not be
  merged just yet,
- ``on hold`` - the PR has been temporarily put on hold for a reason that does
  not fall under any of the other labels. An example would be a case when
  merging the PR would potentially result in a merge conflict with another PR
  that is otherwise difficult to review and update, thus resolving such issues
  would likely be easier on the (less complex) PR itself,
- ``please review`` - the author asked that the PR should be reviewed
  with a higher priority. This label is usually used when the PR has either
  not received enough attention for a considerable period of time, attempts to
  resolve an important issue, or blocks another (important) PR,
- ``question`` - the PR author seeks advice/feedback on some code
  feature and/or design decision. It can also be used by a reviewer to
  ask the PR author for additional explanation before a decision can be
  made on whether the PR meets all the requirements. On top of that,
  this label is occasionally used when a reviewer makes a non-essential
  suggestion for a PR change, but that change is not required to deem
  the PR ready to merge,
- ``wrong branch`` - the author sent the PR to the wrong branch. The
  author should re-issue the same PR against the correct branch.

  IMPORTANT: The last commit **must** be modified and force-pushed again, so
  that the tests are re-run against the new base branch.


.. _reviewing-and-merging-pull-requests:

Reviewing and merging pull requests
-----------------------------------

First of all, make sure that you have properly set up the local
environment, then follow the guidelines described in the next couple of
sections.

Reviewing a new feature PR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The philosophy is simple - verify that the PR implements everything that
is required by the corresponding project task / specification. While
reviewing, it is highly recommended that you also test a few other
application features that might have been affected by the submitted code
changes.

.. _reviewing-a-hotfix-pr:

Reviewing a hotfix PR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hotfixes are all pull requests that go straight into master or release branch.
Review of such branches needs to be done by at least 2 people from the
freemasons committee. The changes allowed must be the minimum amount of changes
to fix a given bug. Hotfix PRs are not allowed to contain any lint or style
changes outside of the that needs to be changed in order to avoid any possible
conflicts when doing a merge back into the develop branch.

After merging a hotfix PR We must create a backemerge PR from master to release
(if needed) and from release to dev branch. Developer who opens those PR must
ensure they get merged as soon as possible, again to as many conflicts as
possible.

.. _reviewing-a-bugfix-pr:

Reviewing a bugfix PR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If reviewing a pull request that contains a bug fix, you **must** first
reproduce the bug on the vanilla ``develop`` branch, i.e. the one
without the PR branch merged. Only after the bug has been reproduced,
you can actually verify that the PR indeed fixes something.

Again, try to also check that the bugfix has not accidentally introduced
any other issues.

Reviewing a PR containing database migration scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: Before clicking "Merge pull request", a developer must test the 
migrations once again by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    git pr <pr_number>
    db_reset

This is needed because migration chain can be out of date if another
migration PR was merged after the last commit on the current PR has 
been pushed.

Pull requests that modify the database (marked with the ``migration``
label) require additional checks to be performed on top of all the
others regular checks, namely the following:

-  The migration works from a clean database,
-  Downgrading and upgrading work on a clean database,
-  Migrations work from the current database state on the main
   ``develop`` branch,
-  Migrations work on a populated database (using the data from the
   ``grc-dev`` instance).


.. _acceptance-criteria:

Acceptance criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A pull request **must be rejected** if **any** of the following is true:

-  It does not do/fix what it claims to and/or it does that only
   partially,
-  The review reveals that the PR has introduced new issues,
-  At least one of the automatic checks on the continuous integration
   server fails, i.e. the build is broken,
-  The new code contains severe readability, logical, performance, and/or
   architectural issues,
-  The new code is not sufficiently covered with automated tests
   (subject to exceptions, e.g. when a test would be disproportionally
   difficult and time-consuming to write, or for little UI changes like
   changing an icon or a font color).

The reviewer must mark the pull request with the ``needs work`` label,
signaling to the author that the PR cannot yet been merged as-is, and
additional changes are required. Along with the tagging, the reviewer
should clearly explain why the PR has temporarily been rejected, and
what needs to be done before it can be merged.

On the other hand, if the PR looks good, it can be merged immediately
(subject to the conditions described in the :ref:`merging-pull-requests`).

Sometimes, however, a PR looks good, but the reviewer is nevertheless
not yet 100% confident with merging it, usually due to its complexity
and/or size, or his own lesser familiarity with the project codebase. In
such cases, the reviewer can still express the approval of the PR, but
defer the final verdict on merging to other reviewers (assign if necessary).


.. _merging-pull-requests:

Merging pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A pull request can be merged only if **all** of the following is true:

-  *You* have gone through all the verification steps and concluded that
   everything works as expected (other people's approvals by themselves
   *are not enough*!),
-  All automatic continuous integration checks have passed,
-  The pull request does not contain **any of your commits**. You are
   not allowed to merge your own work, including the pull requests that
   you have at least partially contributed to,
-  The pull request is **not** labeled with any of the "blocking" labels
   (``code freeze``, ``missing tests``, ``needs work``, ``next release``,
   ``on hold``, ``question``, ``wrong branch``), meaning that not all open
   questions and issues have been resolved yet,
-  The pull request does **not** have any Reviewers assigned that have not yet
   completed their review (seek information on why, if necessary), or if at
   least one of the reviewers has requested changes.

NOTE: After merging a PR that contains a database migration step, the reviewer
must mark all other currently open migration PRs with the ``needs work`` label,
and add a note containing the new ``down_revision`` value in the database
migration chain, so that the authors of those PRs can update their migration
scripts accordingly.
Mind that this only applies to the PRs containing migration scripts in the same
application module as the just merged PR.



Setting up (and tearing down) the environment - step by step guide
------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to better understand how the local environment must be set up,
and as a reference, the following sections describe all the steps in
more details.

*NOTE: Depending on your setup, some of the steps may be omitted. If not
sure, just run them all.*

1. Make sure your local files are up to date:

   ..  code:: bash

       cd to/your/ggrc/clone
       git stash  # make sure you don't have any local changes
       git fetch <remote_main>
       git checkout <remote_main>/develop

   Here ``<remote_main>`` stands for the name of the *remote*
   representing the main development repository, i.e. the one the pull
   requests are sent to. Such a remote is commonly named ``upstream``.

   *NOTE: If the pull request was made against a branch other than
   ``develop``, you need to replace that name accordingly in the
   ``git checkout`` command. The rest of this section assumes that
   ``develop`` is the name of the branch we want to merge the new code
   into.*

2. Test should be done on the merged branch:

   *NOTE: The merge must **not** be a fast-forward, since all pull
   requests are merged with the ``--no-ff`` flag.*

   ..  code:: bash

       git checkout -b temp_branch
       git fetch <pr_origin>
       git merge --no-ff <pr_origin>/<feature_branch_name>

   Here ``<pr_origin>`` stands for the name of the *remote* the pull
   request is originating from. This is most often a fork of the
   ``<remote_main>`` by one of the fellow developers on the project.

   ``<feature_branch_name>`` must of course be replaced with the actual
   name of the remote branch containing the changes, e.g.
   ``feature/CORE-1234``.

   If you don't yet have the ``<pr_origin>`` defined, you need to add it
   (`instructions <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes#Adding-Remote-Repositories>`_).

3. Start your local development environment (Vagrant or Docker). No need
   if you already have it running.

   **If using Vagrant**

   ..  code:: bash

       vagrant up

       # run the following if there were any changes in the provisioning files,
       # requirements, requirements-dev, requirements-selenium, or npm
       requirements...
       vagrant provision

       vagrant ssh

   **If using Docker**

   ..  code:: bash

       # TODO: write Docker commands

4. (optional) Run the database migration

   If the pull request is marked with the ``migration`` label, it
   modifies the database schema, and you thus need to update the schema
   locally as well.

   First, backup the current development database by running the
   following in the development container's console (you will be
   prompted for the database root password):

   ..  code:: bash

       mysqldump ggrcdev -u root -p > db_backup.sql

   With the backup successfully created, run the actual database
   migration:

   ..  code:: bash

       db_migrate

   *NOTE: Database migration must be run from the latest database state
   on the main ``develop`` branch. If your topic branch introduced any
   DB changes, they must first be reverted before running the
   migration.*

5. Rebuild all asset files and launch the application:

   ..  code:: bash

       deploy_appengine extras/deploy_settings_local.sh
       launch_ggrc

6. Test the application in incognito mode.

   *HINT: For incognito mode in Chrome press Ctrl+Shift+n (or
   ⌘Cmd+Shift+n on Mac)*

   *NOTE: You have to close all current incognito browsers to get a
   clean session.*

   Test the pull request as described in the :ref:`reviewing-and-merging-pull-requests` of this guide.

7. Go back to your branch and continue with your work:

   After you have finished verifying the pull request, you can remove
   the temporary branch that was used for testing it:

   ..  code:: bash

       git checkout develop
       git branch -D temp_branch

   ..  code:: bash

       git checkout my/previous-branch
       git stash pop  # only needed if you had any changes stashed in Step 1

   If you tested a ``migration`` pull request, you should also revert
   the database to its previous state by running the following from the
   development container's console:

   ..  code:: bash

       mysql -u root -p ggrcdev < db_backup.sql
       
       
       
Notes for developers and reviewers
----------------------------------

- Read guidelines and go through all required steps during PR review
- Make sure to check for regression before creating and merging PR
- Be extra careful with changing existing unit-tests
- Analize for performance degradation
- Check if existing code can be improved

  - Remove unused code
  - Avoid optional code
  - Avoid deeply nested code, etc
